        To be admitted to Mount Carmel High School, applicants are required to present a satisfactory Std.  V & VI report card or high school transcript, two letters of recommendation, a valid Belize Social Security card, and PSE results. Foreign students are required to provide a certified copy of their birth certificate or passport in place of a social security card. 
        
        All students registered in first form must complete a two or three week summer program in English, Math, SRA, and Study Skills. The cost of the summer school is to be determined by 
        Administration and will be reviewed every year. All students must attend summer classes in their primary school uniform.
        
        Application forms should be accompanied by a non-refundable fee of $10.00 (Ten Belize Dollars). Non Belizean students are required to pay an additional fee of five hundred dollars ($500) per academic year. That is, fifty dollars monthly ($50). Students who are first time repeaters donâ€™t pay any additional fee. Students who are 2nd time repeaters pay an        additional 30% of the regular fee. This includes transfer students.
